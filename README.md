# Digital-Gift-Card
This is a capstone project accomplished by two classmates and me. 
It helps a restaurant to build digital gift card system.
We use HTML5 and CSS for front-end webpage, ASP.NET for back-end application, and MongoDB to save data.
After buying a gift card successfully, the buyer will get a notification to inform that the gift card has been sent to receiver, and the receiver will get an email with an unique gift card as an attachment.
Staff at the restaurant are allowed to generate gift cards for customers.
Admins at the restaurant will have authority to manage the gift cards, such as delete or reactive gift cards. They can also track the details of any generated gift card like Who/When and for Whom the gift card has been generated.
